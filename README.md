# Reasoning-Confidence Guided Search For Multi-Hop Question Answering
## Project Description
This is my research project for POSTECH CSED499A.
* Advised by Wook-Shin Han 
* Data Systems Lab @ POSTECH  
This project investigates the application of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for multi-hop question answering (QA), where multiple documents need to be read and multi-step reasoning is required to generate an answer.
